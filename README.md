# A Simple Maze Generator and Maze Solver

Generates and solves maze using Wilson's Algorithm and Dijkstra's Algorithm
respectively. It didn't necessarily have to be made for the GBA, but I
figured it would be easier than setting up the graphics pipeline for 
the GBA than having to use SDL2. Besides, it comes with the added benefit
of being a challenge to create, given the RAM limitations and the clock speed limitations of the GBA!
